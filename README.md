# book-shop
online book store to demonstrate searchs and a basic ecommerce site this site might not work on VS2015/2017 this site was made on visual studio 2012 using asp.net 4.5 webforms however the code is there for you to feel free to look at 
I built this site to demonstrate how to retrive images from a database and to display them on a view with other data from the
database such as the booktitle within a gridview it was hoped that the web application could display the basket it worked fine on visual 2012 but it has compatability issues with later versions of visual studio
